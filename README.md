# Empathy. Psychology. Education. ðŸ‘‹

If you cut me open, you will find these three elements at my core.<br>
Conversations and activities around them set me on fire. 

I acknowledge every humanâ€™s uniqueness. This helps me develop workable and practical solutions to real-world problems. My philosophical approach to problem solving sets me apart.
