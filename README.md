# Empathy. Psychology. Education. 👋

If you cut me open, you will find these three elements at my core.<br>
Conversations and activities around them set me on fire. 

I acknowledge every human’s uniqueness. This helps me develop workable and practical solutions to real-world problems. My philosophical approach to problem solving sets me apart.


- 🔭 I’m currently working on a research exploring the psychology of fashion; what people wear, and how it affects mood and energy. Buzz me if you're interested, as i'm looking to collaborate on this.
